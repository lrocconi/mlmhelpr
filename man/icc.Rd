\title{Intraclass Correlation (ICC)}
\usage{
icc(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model produced using the \code{lme4::lmer()} or \code{lme4::glmer()} functions. This is an object of class \code{merMod} and subclass \code{lmerMod} or \code{glmerMod}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with random effects and their intraclass correlations.
}
\description{
The \code{icc} function calculates the intraclass correlation (ICC) for multilevel models. The ICC represents the proportion of group-level variance to total variance. The ICC can be calculated for two or more levels in random-intercept models (Hox et al, 2018).

\strong{Note}: For models with random slopes, it is generally advised to interpret with caution. According to Kreft and De Leeuw (1998), "The concept of intra-class correlation is based on a model with a random intercept only. No unique intra-class correlation can be calculated when a random slope is present in the model" (p. 63). However, Snijders and Bosker (2012) offer a calculation to derive this value (equation 7.9). This equation is implemented here.

The \code{icc} function calculates the intraclass correlation for linear mixed-effects models estimated with the \code{lme4::lmer} function or generalized linear mixed-effect model estimated with the \code{lme4::glmer} function with \code{family = binomial(link="logit")}. For logistic models, the estimation method follows Hox et al. (2018, p. 107) recommendation of setting the level-1 residual variance to \eqn{\frac{\pi^2}{3}}. For a discussion different methods for estimating the intraclass correlation for binary responses, see Wu et al. (2012).

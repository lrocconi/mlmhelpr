  abstract = {Multilevel modeling in general concerns models for relationships between variables defined at different levels of a hierarchical data set, which is often viewed as a multistage sample from a hierarchically structured population. Common applications are individuals within groups, repeated measures within individuals, longitudinal modeling, and cluster randomized trials. This chapter treats the multilevel regression model, which is a direct extension of single-level multiple regression, and multilevel structural equation models, which includes multilevel path and factor analysis. Multilevel analysis was originally intended for continuous normally distributed data. This chapter refers to recent extensions to non-normal data but does not treat these in detail. The end of the chapter presents some statistical issues such as assumptions, sample sizes, and applications to data that are not completely nested.},

  abstract = {Educational researchers commonly use the rule of thumb of ``design effect smaller than 2'' as the justification of not accounting for the multilevel or clustered structure in their data. The rule, however, has not yet been systematically studied in previous research. In the present study, we generated data from three different models (which differ in the location of the clustering effect). With a 3 (design effect) \texttimes{} 5 (cluster size) \texttimes{} 4 (number of clusters) Monte Carlo simulation study we found that the rule should not be applied when researchers: (a) are interested in the effects of higher-level predictors, or (b) have a cluster size less than 10. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.},

  abstract = {Collecting data from students within classrooms or schools, and collecting data from students on multiple occasions over time, are two common sampling methods used in educational research that often require multilevel modeling (MLM) data analysis techniques to avoid Type-1 errors. The purpose of this article is to clarify the seven major steps involved in a multilevel analysis: (1) clarifying the research question, (2) choosing the appropriate parameter estimator, (3) assessing the need for MLM, (4) building the level-1 model, (5) building the level-2 model, (6) multilevel effect size reporting, and (7) likelihood ratio model testing. The seven steps are illustrated with both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal MLM example from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) dataset. The goal of this article is to assist applied researchers in conducting and interpreting multilevel analyses and to offer recommendations to guide the reporting of MLM analysis results.},
